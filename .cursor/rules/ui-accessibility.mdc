# UI Accessibility

## Keyboard Navigation
- Implement keyboard navigation using arrow keys and vim-style (j/k) controls
- Maintain focusable elements with proper tabIndex attributes
- Track focused state with useState hooks
- Use refs to programmatically focus elements when needed
- Apply visible focus indicators for all interactive elements

## Focus Management
- Add distinct focus styles to differentiate from hover states
- Use background-color changes for focus indicators (rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1))
- Include text-decoration: underline for focused text elements
- Add outline: none when custom focus styles are implemented
- Ensure all interactive elements have accessible focus states

## Loading States
- Display loading overlays for long-running operations
- Include animated spinners with appropriate aria attributes
- Use fade-in animations for overlay transitions
- Provide clear textual indication of the current operation
- Prevent user interaction during critical loading operations
