# Package Manager Standards

## PNPM Usage
- Use pnpm instead of npm for all package management operations
- Run build commands with 'pnpm run build'
- Create packages with 'pnpm pack'
- Install dependencies with 'pnpm install'
- Add dependencies with 'pnpm add'

## Scripts
- Execute scripts using 'pnpm run' syntax
- Maintain consistent command structure in package.json files
- Use consistent command names across projects
- Leverage pnpm workspaces for monorepo management

## Dependencies
- Use workspace protocol syntax (workspace:*) for internal dependencies
- Lock dependencies with pnpm-lock.yaml
- Manage dependencies at the appropriate workspace level
- Hoist common dependencies to reduce duplication
