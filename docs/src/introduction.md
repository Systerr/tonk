Tonk is a simple toolchain for better vibe coding that helps you build and share applets that integrate with your data and embed into your daily life.

Each app can read and write to the shared state with barely any development overhead - no need to worry about migrations, caching, auth or permissions.

## How it works

`tonk hello` sets up your local **Tonk store** - a super lightweight, local-first data store

`tonk create app` creates a new, LLM-friendly React app that gives strong guidance to Windsurf, Claude or Cursor (you pick)

## Features

Because we replace a traditional server-database architecture with a local-first approach, Tonk apps are:

- Quick to build
- Easy and cheap to manage
- Private by default
- Work offline
- Guaranteed to stay independent from platforms

## Get started

The best place to get started is our [quickstart guide](./quickstart.md).

## Project status

The team behind Tonk is a venture-backed startup based in London.

The _Tonk toolchain_ is in alpha. This is a brand new project built fully in the open, from scratch. Please ask questions in our community or visit our website for more information.

As an early stage project we are very open to feedback and keen to help builders - so please reach out to the team and we will endeavour to support your usecase.
