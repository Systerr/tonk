# Build your own little internet with Tonk

Tonk is a toolchain for independent developers to build and share software that integrates with individual and communal data — without giving up control to third-party platforms.

It helps you:

- Integrate with data  
- Manage state  
- Share applications  
- Permission users  

All in a way that’s copilot-friendly, private & interoperable.

## Get Started

Start building apps and integrations with [our documentation](https://tonk-labs.github.io/tonk/introduction.html).

## Project Status

- **Local-First Architecture**: Built on Automerge for conflict-free data synchronization.
- **Quick Start**: Create new projects instantly with `tonk create`.
- **Offline Support**: IndexedDB-based storage auto syncs when connectivity resumes.
- **Privacy Focused**: Keeps user data local by default.
- **React + TypeScript**: Modern development stack with full type safety.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling out of the box.
- **Package and Share**: Easily deploy and share your Tonk apps (work in progress).

As an early stage project we are very open to feedback and keen to help builders - so please reach out to the team and we will endeavour to support your usecase.
