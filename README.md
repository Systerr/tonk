# Tonk

**Build your own little internet.**

Tonk is a toolchain for independent developers to build and share software that integrates with individual and communal data — without giving up control to third-party platforms.

It helps you:

- Integrate with data  
- Manage state  
- Share applications  
- Permission users  

All in a way that’s copilot-friendly, private & interoperable.

## Project Status

The team behind Tonk is a small, early-stage startup based in London. We are dedicated to building a new and better internet that transfers power away from internet platforms and towards the people and enterprises that use them. Our bet is that the Tonk toolchain & the interoperable ecosystem of Tonk apps will bootstrap that new internet. The Tonk toolchain is in alpha. This is a brand new project built fully in the open, from scratch. Please ask questions in our community or visit our website for more information.

As an early stage project we are very open to feedback and keen to help builders - so please reach out to the team and we will endeavour to support your usecase.
